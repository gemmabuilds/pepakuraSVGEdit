This is a command line application for editing svg files generated by pepakura designer so that those svg's can be easily used in the Cricut Design Space software.

## Installation
You need to have node installed to use this repository. Download the latest version here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/lfitzgibbons/pepakuraSVGEdit.git

Install node modules:

    npm install

## Use
In order to use this application you will need to create an input and an output folder in the same directory as the `app.js` file. Your directory should look something like this:
```
├── pepakuraSVGEdit
│ ├── input
│ ├── node_modules
│ ├── output
│ ├── .gitignore
│ ├── app.js
│ ├── package.json
│ ├── package-lock.json
│ └── README.md
```
Now add your SVG files to the input folder. You will need to manually separate them by page in inkscape.

Once your input files are ready, just run:

    npm build

Now your edited svg pages should be in the output folder. You can load these edited files into the Cricut Design Space.
